# TP WEB 2017

#### The project is build with an MVC architecture :
- ``` M``` stands for model. In our project, model.js defines the different object (lines, rectangles...) classes.
- ``` V``` stands for view (handles the screen display). In our project the ```canvas.html``` file is our principal view file.
- ``` C``` stands for controller (link between model and view). In our project, the principal controller is ```controller.js```.

The MVC architecture is usefull when you want to separate data and view in terms of code. With this kind of architecture, your code is more clear and easier to read/understand.
